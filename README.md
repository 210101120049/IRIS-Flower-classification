Introduction:
The Iris flower dataset is one of the most famous datasets in machine learning and statistics. It consists of 150 samples from each of three species of Iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica). Four features are measured from each sample: the lengths and widths of the sepals and petals. The goal of this project is to classify the species of an Iris flower based on these four features.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify Iris flowers into one of the three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica, based on the input features.

Dataset:
Features:
Sepal Length (in cm)
Sepal Width (in cm)
Petal Length (in cm)
Petal Width (in cm)
Target:
Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
Methodology:
Data Exploration:

Load the dataset and examine its structure and summary statistics.
Check for missing values and clean the data if necessary.
Visualize the distribution of features and the relationships between them using histograms, density plots, pair plots, and correlation heatmaps.
Data Visualization:

Use various plotting techniques to explore the dataset and understand the distribution of different species across the features.
Generate pair plots to visualize the relationships between different features for each species.
Create a heatmap to analyze the correlation between the features.
Model Building:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the models.
Implement various classification algorithms:
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Decision Tree Classifier
Train each model on the training set and evaluate its accuracy on the test set.
Model Evaluation:

Calculate accuracy for each model to compare their performance.
Use confusion matrices to evaluate the performance of the models in detail.
Visualize the performance of the models using bar plots for easy comparison.
Result Analysis:

Discuss the results of the models and identify which model performed the best.
Analyze the confusion matrices to understand the types of errors made by the models.
Provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model.
Conclusion:
The project will conclude with a summary of the findings, including which model performed the best for Iris flower classification and why. It will also include reflections on the effectiveness of the features used and suggestions for any potential improvements or future work.
